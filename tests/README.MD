## How to run

1. Install the requirements.txt via `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
2. Make sure you have the system image "system-images;android-30;google_apis;x86" installed (installed via `sdkmanager "system-images;android-30;google_apis;x86"`)
3. Simply run with `pytest pyavd_test.py`

NOTE: Tests may take some time, because the avdmanager is slow
